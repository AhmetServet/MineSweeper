## Classic MineSweeper Game  

This project presents a classic Mine Sweeper game, faithfully recreated with Java Swing. Featuring adjustable difficulty levels and intuitive controls, it offers a nostalgic experience for veterans and a challenging introduction for newcomers. Explore the grid, uncover numbered tiles, and strategically flag potential mines. 

- Using cheat mode, you can see through the tiles without opening them.
